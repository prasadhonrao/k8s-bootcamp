# Give me an example of a pod that uses an Azure File volume for storage.

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: azure-file-pod
# spec:
#   containers:
#     - name: azure-file-volume
#       image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
#       ports:
#         - containerPort: 80
#       volumeMounts:
#         - name: azure
#           mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
#   volumes:
#     - name: azure
#       azureFile:
#         secretName: azure-secret
#         shareName: myshare
#         readOnly: false
#         storageAccountName: mystorageaccount
#         storageAccountKey: mykey
