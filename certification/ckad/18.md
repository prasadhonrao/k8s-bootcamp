# CKAD Practice Question - 18

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with a specific node selector using `kubectl`.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `node-selector-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should be scheduled on a node with the label `disktype=ssd`.
4. Verify that the Pod is scheduled on the correct node.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pod node-selector-pod` to confirm that the Pod is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod node-selector-pod` to verify the node selector has been applied.
3. Check the node labels with `kubectl get nodes --show-labels` to confirm the Pod is running on a node with `disktype=ssd`.

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run node-selector-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --overrides='
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "spec": {
    "nodeSelector": {
      "disktype": "ssd"
    }
  }
}'
```
