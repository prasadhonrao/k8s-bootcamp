# CKAD Practice Question - 5

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with specific resource requests and limits using the `kubectl run` command.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `resource-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should request 100m CPU and 128Mi memory.
4. The Pod should have a CPU limit of 500m and a memory limit of 512Mi.
5. Verify that the resource requests and limits are correctly applied.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the `resource-pod` is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod resource-pod` to check the resource requests and limits for CPU and memory.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run resource-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --requests='cpu=100m,memory=128Mi' --limits='cpu=500m,memory=512Mi'
```
