# CKAD Practice Question - 20

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod using `kubectl` with specific resource requests and limits and validate it using the `kubectl` describe command.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `resource-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should request 100m CPU and 128Mi memory.
4. The Pod should have a CPU limit of 500m and a memory limit of 512Mi.
5. Verify the resource requests and limits have been correctly applied.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pod resource-pod` to ensure that the Pod is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod resource-pod` to check if the CPU and memory requests and limits are set correctly.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run resource-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --requests='cpu=100m,memory=128Mi' --limits='cpu=500m,memory=512Mi'
```
