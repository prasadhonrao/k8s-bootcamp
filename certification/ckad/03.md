# CKAD Practice Question - 3

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Deployment and a corresponding Service using imperative `kubectl` commands.

## Requirements

1. The Deployment should be named `nginx-deployment`.
2. The Deployment should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Deployment should create 3 replicas.
4. The Service should be named `nginx-service`.
5. The Service should expose the `nginx-deployment` on port 80.
6. The Service should use a `ClusterIP` type.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get deployments` to confirm that the `nginx-deployment` exists.
2. Use `kubectl get pods` to check that 3 pods are running for the Deployment.
3. Use `kubectl get services` to confirm that the `nginx-service` exists.
4. Use `kubectl describe service nginx-service` to verify the details of the Service.

## Solution

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx:1.23.1 --replicas=3
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --name=nginx-service --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=ClusterIP
```
