# CKAD Practice Question - 8

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with multiple containers and verify them.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `multi-container-pod`.
2. It should contain two containers:
   - The first container should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
   - The second container should use the `busybox` image with the tag `1.32.0-ucl` and run the command `sleep 3600`.
3. Verify that both containers are running in the Pod.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the `multi-container-pod` is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod multi-container-pod` to verify that both containers are present.
3. Use `kubectl logs multi-container-pod -c nginx` to view the logs of the nginx container.
4. Use `kubectl logs multi-container-pod -c busybox` to view the logs of the busybox container.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run multi-container-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --image=busybox:1.32.0-ucl --command -- sleep 3600
```
