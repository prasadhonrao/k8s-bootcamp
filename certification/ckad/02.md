# CKAD Practice Question - 2

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Deployment using an imperative `kubectl` command.

## Requirements

1. The Deployment should be named `nginx-deployment`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Deployment should create 3 replicas.
4. Verify that the Deployment has been successfully created with the desired number of replicas.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get deployments` to confirm the `nginx-deployment` exists.
2. Use `kubectl get pods` to check that 3 pods are running for the Deployment.
3. Describe the Deployment using `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment` to verify the image, replicas, and other details.

## Solution

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx:1.23.1 --replicas=3
```
