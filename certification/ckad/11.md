## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with a label and use the `kubectl` label selector to retrieve it.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `label-selector-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should have a label `app=web` attached to it.
4. Verify that the Pod is retrieved using a label selector.

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pods --selector=app=web` to confirm that the Pod is retrieved using the label selector.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod label-selector-pod` to confirm the label `app=web` is correctly set.

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run label-selector-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --labels=app=web
```
