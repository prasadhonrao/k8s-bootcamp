# CKAD Practice Question - 13

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with a dry-run flag to validate before actual creation.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `dryrun-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. Use the `--dry-run` flag to validate the creation of the Pod without actually creating it.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use the `--dry-run` flag to check the output of the Pod creation without making any changes.
2. Verify that no actual Pod is created by running `kubectl get pods`.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run dryrun-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --dry-run=client
```
