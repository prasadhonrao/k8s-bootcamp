# CKAD Practice Question - 27

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod using a YAML file, make changes, and then apply the changes using `kubectl`.

## Requirements

1. Create a Pod definition in a YAML file with the following:
   - The Pod should be named `yaml-pod`.
   - It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
   - Set the restart policy to `Always`.
2. After creating the Pod using the YAML file, modify the YAML to update the image to `nginx:1.24.0`.
3. Apply the changes using `kubectl`.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Create a YAML file called `yaml-pod.yaml` with the Pod definition.
2. Use `kubectl apply -f yaml-pod.yaml` to create the Pod.
3. Use `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the Pod is running with the `nginx:1.23.1` image.
4. Modify the `yaml-pod.yaml` file to update the image to `nginx:1.24.0`.
5. Apply the changes using `kubectl apply -f yaml-pod.yaml`.
6. Verify that the Pod's image has been updated by running `kubectl describe pod yaml-pod`.

---

## Solution

1. Create the initial `yaml-pod.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: yaml-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.23.1
  restartPolicy: Always
```
