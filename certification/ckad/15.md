# CKAD Practice Question - 15

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod using `kubectl run` with resource requests and limits, and verify using `kubectl`.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `resource-limits-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should request 200m CPU and 256Mi memory.
4. The Pod should have a CPU limit of 800m and a memory limit of 1Gi.
5. Verify that the resource requests and limits have been applied correctly.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pod resource-limits-pod` to confirm the Pod is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod resource-limits-pod` to verify the CPU and memory requests and limits.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run resource-limits-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --requests='cpu=200m,memory=256Mi' --limits='cpu=800m,memory=1Gi'
```
