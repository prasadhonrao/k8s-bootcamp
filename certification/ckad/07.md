# CKAD Practice Question - 7

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with an environment variable and verify it.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `env-var-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should have an environment variable `ENVIRONMENT=production`.
4. Verify that the environment variable is set correctly.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pods` to confirm the Pod `env-var-pod` is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod env-var-pod` to verify that the `ENVIRONMENT` variable is set to `production`.
3. Alternatively, use `kubectl exec` to run `env` inside the Pod and check if the `ENVIRONMENT` variable is available.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run env-var-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --env="ENVIRONMENT=production"
```
