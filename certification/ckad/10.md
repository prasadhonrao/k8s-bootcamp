# CKAD Practice Question - 10

## Objective

Create a Kubernetes Pod with a custom port and verify it.

## Requirements

1. The Pod should be named `custom-port-pod`.
2. It should use the `nginx` image with the tag `1.23.1`.
3. The Pod should expose port `8080` internally.
4. Verify that the Pod is running and the port is correctly exposed.

---

## Steps for Validation

1. Use `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the `custom-port-pod` is running.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod custom-port-pod` to verify that port `8080` is exposed.
3. Use `kubectl port-forward pod/custom-port-pod 8080:8080` to verify connectivity to the port.

---

## Solution

```bash
kubectl run custom-port-pod --image=nginx:1.23.1 --port=8080
```
