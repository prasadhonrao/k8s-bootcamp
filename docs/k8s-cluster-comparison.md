Keep in mind that the choice between self-managed and cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters depends on factors like expertise, operational preferences, budget, and specific use cases. Organizations may opt for self-managed clusters when they require complete control and customization, while cloud-hosted clusters offer simplicity and convenience with managed services.
