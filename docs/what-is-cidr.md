# Explain CIDR to a 5 yr old

Imagine you have a big box of candies, and you want to share them with your friends, but you want to make sure everyone gets a fair share. That's a bit like what CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) does for the internet.

CIDR helps organize and distribute internet addresses in a fair way. Internet addresses are like street addresses for computers. They look like this: 192.168.1.1.

Now, let's say you have a lot of houses on your street, and you want to group them together to make it easier for the mailman to deliver mail. Instead of giving each house a different list of candy amounts, you can use CIDR to make a simple rule.

CIDR uses a special notation like this: 192.168.1.0/24. The "/24" part is like a rule that says, "The first 24 candies in the box are for these houses on this street." So, all the houses on your street can share those 24 candies equally.

If you have another street with different houses, you can use a different rule like 192.168.2.0/24. This way, each street gets its own set of candies, and it's easy to keep track of who gets what.

CIDR helps the internet work smoothly by organizing and sharing internet addresses efficiently, just like you would share candies with your friends by making rules.
